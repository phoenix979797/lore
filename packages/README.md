# lore/packages

For the time being, all publishable packages live in this folder.  The downside is this makes it hard to tell 
which packages are naturally grouped together.  Therefore, they are grouped together as follows:  

## lore
* lore

## libraries
* lore-backbone
* lore-utils

## hooks
* lore-actions
* lore-auth
* lore-bind-actions
* lore-collections
* lore-config
* lore-connect
* lore-connection-map
* lore-connections
* lore-environment
* lore-initializers
* lore-models
* lore-normalize
* lore-reducers
* lore-redux
* lore-request
