# lore

[![Build Status][circle-image]][circle-url]

Convention driven framework for React + Redux applications. Build apps worthy of legend.

>"We called it `lore` because `opinions!` was already taken."

> The Creators

Finish the README!  Talk about how to install, link to docs, thanks people! (React, Redux, React-Router, Sails).

Need to mention the project adhers to semantic versioning...link to examples...

Can we add a gist? If one exists, it's probably just pointing out the boilerplate we've consumed in conventions, or
possibly a very condensed version of the motivation/opinions driving this framework.

## Installation
**With [node](http://nodejs.org) installed:**
```sh
# Get the latest stable release of the lore-cli
$ npm install lore-cli -g
```

## Your first lore Project
**Create a new app:**
```sh
# Create a new lore app
$ lore new [path-to-your-project-name]
```
This will create a new lore app at the path you specified, with the same name.

**Run app:**
```sh
# cd into [path-to-your-project-name]
# Run your lore app
$ npm start
```
