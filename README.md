Convention driven framework for React + Redux applications. Heavily opinionated and highly respectful.

>"We called it `lore` because `opinions` was already taken."

> The Creators

**PLEASE NOTE**: Lore is not recommended for use in production. It is still in active development, and among other reasons,
has no built in support for pagination yet (coming soon). We also need to upgrade react-router to v2, which will change
the new project template and many of the generators. Additionally, the project does not yet support a dedicated ES6 
experience, which we know many of you will prefer (also coming soon).

**IMMEDIATE TERM FOCUS**
1. Upgrade react-router to v2
2. Support ES6 version of the new project template
3. Support ES6 versions of all the generators

TODO:
Finish the README!  Talk about how to install, link to docs, thanks people! (React, Redux, React-Router, Sails, Storcery).

Need to mention the project adhers to semantic versioning...link to examples...

Can we add a gist? If one exists, it's probably just pointing out the boilerplate we've consumed in conventions, or
possibly a very condensed version of the motivation/opinions driving this framework.

Maybe just point straight to the docs?
