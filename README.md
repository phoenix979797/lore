Convention driven framework for React + Redux applications. Heavily opinionated and highly respectful.

### NOT FOR PRODUCTION
**PLEASE NOTE**: Lore is not currently recommended for use in production. It is still in active development, and 
among other reasons, does not yet have built in support for pagination (coming soon). Additionally, the project does not 
yet support a dedicated ES6 experience, which we know many of you will prefer (also coming soon).

### Videos

If you want to dive in and understand why Lore was created, what problems it's trying to solve, and how it solves them (or plans to solve them), please see the following videos.

### Documentation

You can find the documentation for Lore hosted on Gitbook at https://www.lorejs.org

### Tutorial

At the moment the videos are a far better way to learn about the framework and what it
can do. That being said, [there is an issue](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues/90) created specifically to discuss 
ideas for improving the tutorial.


### Near-term Focus

Since Lore is still in active development, I'm going to list the things that have immediate focus here.

1. Finish uploading missing videos mentioned above.
2. Clean up docs & give each challenge mentioned in "Advanced Use Cases" a dedicated doc page
3. Upgrade react-router to v2
4. Support ES6 version of the new project template
5. Support ES6 versions of all the generators
6. Add support for pagination
