  Ye intruders beware - Goonies (1985)
```

You have entered the advanced section of the docs.
This section is intended for those who want to get the most out of Lore's capabilities.

* [Anatomy](/docs/advanced/anatomy/README.md)
* [Extending Lore](/docs/advanced/extending/README.md)
* [Architecture](/docs/advanced/architecture/README.md)

Things that need to be added here:

1. Overriding actions, both with a blueprint template (for modifying Action Types) as well as with a full custom
implementation.
2. Overriding reducers
