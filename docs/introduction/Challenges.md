## Advanced Challenges

There are a lot of demands on front-end applications as they evolve to support the growing needs of the user base. 
Lore's goal is to build support for many of those common feature concerns into the architecture. 

This video discusses how the client-side architecture you start with can impact your development speed as your 
application grows, and lays the foundation for the value proposition the framework provides to more advanced developers.
