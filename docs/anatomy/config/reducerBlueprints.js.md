# app/config/reducerBlueprints.js

### Purpose

This file is where you define overrides for the default reducer blueprints.

```js
/**
 * Configuration file for reducer blueprints
 */

module.exports = {

  /****************************************************************************
  *                                                                           *
  * No options currently exist, however this will eventually allow you to     *
  * specify whether blueprints should be on or off, and which reducers should *
  * have them all, which should only have some, and which should have none    *
  *                                                                           *
  ****************************************************************************/

};
```
