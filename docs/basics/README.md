# Basics

This section will cover all the basic concepts you need to know to use Lore, in the way that they apply to Lore. For
example, if you aren't familiar with Actions or Reducers (Redux concepts) it's highly recommended you learn about them
through some of the official documentation and educational channels. But if you want to know how they're used in Lore,
and how Lore implements them within the framework, you can learn about that here.

Lore takes the approach of trying to hide as much of the complexity of a React/Redux/React-Router/Webpack app as possible
early on, following an approach of "learn about it as you need to". Starting out, you may not need to know much about
these concepts, but as your application becomes more demanding, you may start wanting to tailor specific behaviors
to meet your needs. The documentation for that will be here and in [Recipes](../recipes/README.md).
