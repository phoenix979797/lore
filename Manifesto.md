# Manifesto

This document is intended to serve as a high level expression of the architectural perspective of this framework. The
principles expressed below will weigh heavily into architectural designs as the framework moves forward and continues
to evolve.

This idea is taken from [GangPlank](http://gangplankhq.com), because GangPlank is awesome and [their manifesto is awesome](http://gangplankhq.com/vision/manifesto/).

* Overridable conventions over configuration!

* Long-term scalability over short-term ease (otherwise known as everything shold be magical, but we want you to be able to slay dragons, but just jellies)

* Real-time! Eventually!  Because real-time is needed for good collaboration, and true greatness is born from collaboration.

* More stuff to come!  Like being nice, and inclusion, and helping everyone be successful together!
