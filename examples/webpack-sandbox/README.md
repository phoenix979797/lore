# webpack-sandbox

Example application that demonstrates what the Webpack config is intended to provide out of the box, and provides a means to test it with various browsers (though outside of the fonts, everything should work on every browser).

## Other Future Features
May include a section for favicons in the future, to demonstrate that they are (or can be) created for various devices and sizes.

May include a section in the future for syntax, to show which language features are supported by default (like static property types, decorators, classes, etc). That might be strange though...since that's less a Webpack thing, and more a Babel thing.
