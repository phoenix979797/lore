## Usage

This example uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to provide an API for the example. All data
is stored persistently in the `db.json` file at the root of the project.

To start the API server, run this command:

```
npm run server
```

Next, run webpack to build and serve the project:

```
npm start
```

Finally, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the example.
